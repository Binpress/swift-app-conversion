#Converting an Objective-C app to Swift: Working with web data

This is the source code for the Binpress tutorial, [*Converting an Objective-C app to Swift: Working with web data*](http://www.binpress.com/tutorial/unity3d-ai-navmesh-navigation/119).

The article takes the example app created in [this tutorial](http://www.binpress.com/tutorial/learn-objectivec-building-an-app-part-12-working-with-web-data/105) and converts it to Swift. The source for the original Objective-C app can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Binpress/learn-objective-c-in-24-Days).
